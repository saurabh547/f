1)Enumerating hosts 
Enumerating hosts Host enumeration is the process of gaining specific particulars regarding a 
defined host. 
Live host discovery The first step is to run network ping sweeps against a target address space and 
look for responses that indicate that a particular target is live and capable of responding.

2)Writing your own port scanner using netcat  
Fingerprinting the operating system 
While attackers utilize the proxying application and Tor network, it is also possible to write their own 
custom network port scanner. 
Determining the OS of a remote system is conducted using two types of scans:  
 Active fingerprinting: The attacker sends normal and malformed packets to the target and 
records its response pattern, referred to as the fingerprint. 
 Passive fingerprinting: The attacker sniffs—or records—and analyzes the packet stream to 
determine the characteristics of the packets.

==>sudo nmap -sS -O 217.21.91.79
==>nc -v -z www.guimp.com 1-5000

a)Identification and enumeration of internal network hosts 
==>ifconfig
==>cat /etc/resolv.conf

b)ARP broadcasting 
==>sudo arp-scan 217.21.91.79

c)Ping sweep 
==>nmap -sP -PT 80 10.10.10.80/24
==>fping -g 10.10.10.80/24

d)Native MS Windows commands Nslookup 
==>nslookup www.facebook.com

==>netstat -n -o

e)Taking advantage of SNMP 
==>sudo snmpwalk -c public 50.24.32.130 -v1
==>msfconsole

f)Locating network shares
==>enum4linux 10.10.10.100

g)Reconnaissance of active directory domain servers
==>rpcclient -U "administrator" 10.10.10.100

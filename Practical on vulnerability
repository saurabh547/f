1)Web application vulnerability scanners 
a)Nikto 
Nikto is one of the most utilized active web application scanners. It performs comprehensive tests 
against web servers. Nikto identifies server misconfiguration, index files, and HTTP methods, and 
also finds the installed web server and the software version.

==>nikto -h nbmbordicollege.com -p 80

b)OWASP ZAP 
One of the most effective scanners based on the number of verified vulnerabilities discovered is 
OWASP ZAP. 
It can be installed by running ==>sudo apt install zaproxy  from a terminal and opened by running 
zaproxy

2)Vulnerability scanners for mobile applications 
Mobile Security Framework (MobSF) 
Mobile Security Framework (MobSF) is an open-source, automated penetration testing framework 
for all the mobile platforms, including Android, iOS, and Windows. The entire framework is written in 
the Django Python framework. This framework can be directly downloaded from 
https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework- MobSF , it can be cloned in Kali Linux by 
issuing the git clone https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF  
Once the framework is cloned, use the following steps to bring up the mobile application scanner: 
1. cd into the Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF folder:

==>cd Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/ 

2. Install the dependencies using the following command:  
==>sudo apt install python3-venv  
==>sudo python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt  
==>sudo ./setup.sh  
==>sudo ./run.sh Test 

3.Once all the installation is complete, check the configuration settings by entering sudo ./setup.sh 
or ==>sudo python3 setup.py install. That should set up all the prerequisites and also do all the 
migration seeding to the database.

4.==>./run.sh 127.0.0.1:8000

5.Access the URL http://yourIPaddress:Portnumber in the browser and upload any mobile 
applications found during the reconnaissance to the scanner to identify the entry points. 

6.Once the files are uploaded, penetration testers can identify the disassembled file in the scanner, 
along with all the other important information:

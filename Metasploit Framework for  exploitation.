The Metasploit Framework (MSF) is an open-source tool designed to facilitate penetration testing. 
Written in the Ruby programming language, it uses a modular approach to facilitating exploits during 
the exploitation phase in cyber kill chain methodology. 
Database setup and configuration  
It is fairly simple to set up the new version of Metasploit, since Metasploit does not run as a service 
anymore, since version msf3:  
1. Start PostgreSQL by running sudo systemctl start postgresql.service in the terminal. 
2. Initialize the Metasploit database by running sudo msfdb init. Unless it is your first time 
doing this, the initialization will create the msf database, create a role, and add the msf_test 
and msf databases to the /usr/share/metasploitframework/config/database.yml 
configuration file; otherwise, by default, the msf database will be created in the prebuild of 
Kali Linux, as shown 
3. Now, you are ready to access msfconsole. 

==>sudo service postgresql start
==>sudo msfdb init
==>msfconsole
==>msf6 > db_nmap -sV -sC -p 3306 10.10.10.8
==>msf6 > search mysql

To instruct Metasploit that we will attack the target with this exploit, we issue the following 
command:  
msf6> use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor 
Metasploit prompts the tester to select the payload (a reverse shell from the compromised 
system back to the attacker) and sets the other variables, which are listed as follows:  
1.Remote host (RHOST): This is the IP address of the system being attacked. 
2.Remote port (RPORT): This is the port number that is used for the exploit.
